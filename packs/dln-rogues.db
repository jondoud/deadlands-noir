Most of the reanimated corpses encountered, even in the Crescent City, are walkin' dead. Even the quickanddirty creatures animated by the bokkor using the zombie power are just short-unlived walkin' dead. Zombies, on the other hand, are the big guns of the Red Sect-and they are far more rare. Creating a zombie takes considerable preparation. The bokkor begins working on his victim long before the poor sucker checks into a graveyard, administering a combination of arcane poisons and ritual curses. After the victim dies, the ritual process continues over the next three nights at the soon-to-be undead juggernaut's burial site. Given the popularity of the necropolises in New Orleans, pulling those nightly ceremonies off undisturbed is no mean feat! Once reanimated, zombies are virtually invulnerable, hideously strong, and incapable of betraying the bokkors' wishes. While the abominations do have a couple of obscure weaknesses, one is impossible in the heat of combat and the other isn't even feasible out of sight of the ocean. Other than dismemberment or completely consuming the undead body by fire- something that takes several hours-zombies are almost unstoppable once given a command, which is usually to kill. In general, the only way to defeat one of these monsters is to catch it while it is inert or trap it in a stone or concrete room sufficient to withstand its terrible strength.</p></div>"},"species":{"name":"Zombie"},"archetype":"","currency":0,"wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":false,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{"value":0,"max":0},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":0,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Bestiary","details":"<ol class=\"savagedus-advances\"></ol>"},"bennies":{"value":2,"max":0},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":false},"token":{"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","name":"Zombie","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"actorId":"1PBj5pQLAlMsZsvB"},"items":[{"name":"Fighting","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skills/punch.svg","data":{"description":"<div class=\"swade-core\">\n<p>Fighting covers all hand-to-hand (melee) attacks, whether it&rsquo;s with fists, axes, laser swords, or martial arts.

Eventually, some of those creatures sought the protection of the earth to escape the sun's burning rays. Over time, these undead have evolved into the subterranean, burrowing nightmare called diggers. Diggers are completely blind, and in fact, no longer even have eyes. Instead, they have developed a finetuned sense of hearing and touch that allows them to hunt their prey from under the surface, dragging them beneath the soil often before the victims realize what's happening. Even above ground, their preternatural senses function almost like passive sonar, able to detect even the slightest noise with amazing precision. These creatures look like bald, emaciated humans. Their eye sockets are not only empty but completely overgrown with flesh. Coarse, brown claws sprout from their fingers and toes, and chisel-like incisors protrude from their withered lips. Although they rarely speak, when they do it is limited to a sibilant, hissing growl.</p></div>"},"species":{"name":"Digger"},"archetype":"","currency":0,"wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":false,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{"value":0,"max":0},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":0,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Bestiary","details":"<ol class=\"savagedus-advances\"></ol>"},"bennies":{"value":2,"max":0},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":false},"token":{"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","name":"Digger","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"actorId":"KPUFTauuYjCR4aV7"},"items":[{"name":"Fighting","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skills/punch.svg","data":{"description":"<div class=\"swade-core\">\n<p>Fighting covers all hand-to-hand (melee) attacks, whether it&rsquo;s with fists, axes, laser swords, or martial arts.

The catch is once a cadaver has been underwater for a month or more its flesh begins being replaced by a substance scientists and doctors call adipocere. Less learned sorts call it corpse or grave wax-which you have to admit is a lot more colorful term. When a manitou latches onto one of these waterlogged corpses, the end result is a bit different from the run-of-themill walkin' dead. Being submerged in water for long periods of time does all sorts of unpleasant things to a carcass. Grave wax is lighter and bulkier than the fat it replaces, lending a grotesque bloated appearance to the body, hence the common name of this type of walkin' dead. Undead of this sort also have grayish-white flesh and an odor distinctly different from old-fashioned zombies, not unlike old, moldy cheese. Bloats, by the nature of their transformed flesh, are particularly resistant to puncture wounds, including those caused by bullets. Arrows, bullets, and the like find little resistance in the abominations' waxen bodies and pass harmlessly through them. However, alcohol acts like acid on the creatures, dissolving them wherever it comes in contact. These undead are usually found in the Maze, the bayous of the South, and large rivers, but are possible anywhere a body may have been submerged in water for long periods of time. Although they frequently come ashore (or clamber onto boats) to attack the living, they usually return to their watery graves sooner or later.</p></div>"},"species":{"name":"Bloat"},"archetype":"","currency":0,"wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":false,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{"value":0,"max":0},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":0,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Bestiary","details":"<ol class=\"savagedus-advances\"></ol>"},"bennies":{"value":2,"max":0},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":false},"token":{"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","name":"Bloat","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"actorId":"hzaK0MIF3mpNMB30"},"items":[{"name":"Fighting","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skills/punch.svg","data":{"description":"<div class=\"swade-core\">\n<p>Fighting covers all hand-to-hand (melee) attacks, whether it&rsquo;s with fists, axes, laser swords, or martial arts.

The drawback to this hooch-called \"red rum\"—is that on top of the usual risk of going blind, sometimes the drinker turns into a rampaging abomination! The vast majority of the time, a person with this affliction lives his life normally. But during times of great stress he changes into his monstrous form and is driven to commit acts of mayhem and violence. Any time a person who suffers from this malady draws a face card for his initiative, he transforms into a Hyde. Of course, as Marshal, you're also free to inflict the change whenever works best for your adventure! Hydes possess an animal-like cunning. They take delight in violence and the pain of others and hold little loyalty to anyone but themselves, often lashing out at their closest friends and loved ones.

They're a subtle abomination that seeks to corrupt the souls of mortals, leading them to damnation. These monsters favor the innocent, but are happy to deal with anyone willing to bargain with them. Folks interested in making a deal with the Devil, so to speak, can summon these abominations through a variety of rituals. The demons aren't picky; they respond to virtually any such ceremony. The most popular-at least in the South—usually revolves burying some sort of personal trinket around remote rural crossroads, often at midnight, hence the creatures' name. In return, the crossroads demon asks for only a small part of the bargainer's soul. These demons gladly offer strength, power, love, wealth, or just about anything else the summoner requests. The \"gift\" is usually delivered subtly within a few days or weeks. Riches may come in the form of a lucrative contract, an inheritance, or rarely finding some sort of treasure.
